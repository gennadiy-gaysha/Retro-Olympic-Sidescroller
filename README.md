## Tech
In the tech section, we provide information about the technology stack, dependencies, and any technical details related to the project.

Kaboom.js

## Credits
We would like to give credit to the following individuals, organizations, and resources that have contributed to the project or provided inspiration:

### Resources consulted

- Simple sidescroller games were researched as they had well resourced tutorials and were easy to implement

#### KaBoom.js Resources

- https://kaboomjs.com/
- https://kaboomjs.com/doc/intro 

  ***
#### Flappy Bird Resources

##### Reverse Flappy Game, "Learn to Make a Game with Kaboom.js in 39 Minutes - Step-by-Step Tutorial", 

- Youtube Tutorial https://youtu.be/hgReGsh5xVU
- Repo for code https://replit.com/@ykdojo/flappy-2#code/main.js

a flying version of the "chrome dino" game. 

The demo shows someones process of making a game with Kaboom.js. It was very helpful to see how they structured their code and how they used the Kaboom.js library.

MVP Features included
- Sprite character 
  - that would be stick to the same place in the viewport while the background changed.
  - The sprite could move up and down
- a Background that would change when the player up and down in the game
  - obstacles that would appear in the background

Extra features included
- a score that would increase as the sprite passed one onstacle
- music that would play in the background
- sound effects, e.g. "woosh" when the sprite moved up and down

Limitations of the project
- appeared to be limited to smaller viewport sizes. When the viewport was increased, the obstacles would not fill the screen.
- Reverse flappy didn't appear to run at all

very simple "chrome-dino" game and seems to work well.
